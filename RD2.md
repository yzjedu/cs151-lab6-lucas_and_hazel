# Reflection Document

* Drive Full Name  : Hazel Osborne
* Partner Full Name: Lucas Podowski
* Student ID: 1930197

_Objective:_

**What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?**

Designing and programming functions, testing code, reading others code.

_Procedure:_

**What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?**

First we read the read me file. Then we discussed which section to make into their own functions. After this, we wrote the algorithm together, and lastly created and tested the code.


**What were the Key concepts explored?**

Pair programming, writing algorithms, loops, error checking

_Results_:

**Did your results match what you expected to get?**

Yes. I personally had a couple issues fully understanding how to get variables to transfer to and from functions. After a bit of online research, I figured it out. 

**Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?**

Yes. The code has error checking in place to re-prompt user to enter until a valid input is given.

_Reflection:_

**What challenges did you encounter?**

As I stated earlier, I had a bit of trouble using the define functions properly. 

**How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?**

1. Think before Programming: We read the read me file and completed the algorithm before starting to program.
2. Program is the embodiment of the algorithm: Our code follows the algorithm
3. Improve through practice: By completing this Lab, I improved my algorithm, flowchart, and programming skills. 

**Did you overcome them, and how?**

Yes. After online research and some trial and error, we figured it out. 

**Any key takeaways?**

Comments are important.

**Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?**

Yes I do. I feel much more comfortable defining and programming functions. 

**What was it like working with your partner?****
Great! He's nice, smart, and we have good discussions about how to solve the problems.
